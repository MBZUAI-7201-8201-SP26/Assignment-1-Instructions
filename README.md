## Assignment (Lab) 1: What to Submit + Cross-Validation

### Part 0: Join the GitHub Classroom
* Join by accepting the invitation here: https://classroom.github.com/a/6c16an45
* You will be prompted to link your GitHub account to your name:

* An invitation will be sent to the email of your GitHub Account. Please accept the invitation (make sure you are on the correct account) so you can access your private repo for this assignment, otherwise it will show "Repository Access Issue":

### Part 1: Do the Lab (your repo)

* Read the Assignment (Lab) 1 document, and complete the exercises.
* Save evidence that things ran (terminal output, logs, screenshots, etc.).
* **The two important deliverables are:**

  * **Exercise 1:** tiled matmul on general CPU
  * **Exercise 7:** tiled matmul on Tenstorrent
* Commit/push your **source code** for both into your GitHub Classroom Repo of Assignment 1
* The other exercises are mainly there to teach you how to run/debug/profile. Familiarize yourself with them.
* Write a simple but clear `README.md` that lets someone else reproduce your results.

### Part 2: Cross-Validation (check another group)

You’ll be randomly assigned another group’s repos.

* Read their README.
* Try to follow it exactly and reproduce their results.
* Check whether your output matches what they claim.
* If something doesn’t match, note:
  
  * what step failed / what seems wrong
  * any bugs or missing steps
* Save your reproduction evidence (logs, screenshots, notes) and include it in your submission.
